## Introduction

The Silver Gym website is designed for individuals searching for a high qaulity gym. The purpose of this website is to showcase the facilities offered at this gym as well as the type of experience you can expect while using this gym.  The features of this website such as the gallery are aimed at motivating the customer to use silver gym for their fitness goals. 
This website mainly focuses on informing potential customers about the facilities offered at this gym and what they can expect by joining. The page about trainers informs and motivates potential customers about the benifits they can get by joining and having access to highly qualified personal trainers. The Silver Gym website encourages people to join the gym to help keep their body healthy and strong.
Silver Gym website is my first Milestone Project out of five and it s part of Full Stack Web development course at thr Code Institute.
I mainly used HTML5 and CSS3 to make this website.

 # Design

 ### Colour Schema
 * I used two colours for the background and content, which are white and dark grey. I have also used a small amount of green for hover and black for paragraph.
* I chose all the colours I used from [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) website.

### Typography
* I selected the font I used  from the [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/) website and linked it with my Css file.
* I used three font style Lato,Oswald and sans-serif.
* I have used Lato only for the paragraphs.
* I have used Oswald for the headings.
* I have used the font Sans-serif for backup in instances where if correct link isnt provided to the css3 file then your Goole font will not work but sans-serif always works.

### Imagery
* The images used in this website play a very important role in the user experience of the website.
* The images shown on the website have been selected to motivate the potential customer and encourage them to join the gym. They have also been included to educate new gym users on basic excersie tecniques.
* All the images are downloaded free from the [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/gym%20and%20fitness/) website.
