 # Design

 ### Colour Schema
 * I used two colours for background and content that is white, dark gray and little bit green used for hover on it and black for paragraph.
* I chosed all the colour from [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) website.

### Typography
* The font i chosed from [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/) website and linked it with my Css file.
* I used three font style Lato,Oswald and sans-serif.
* Lato font used only for paragraph.
* Oswald used only for headings.
* Sans-serif font just for backup like some time if you don't give right link to css then your Goole font dosn't work but sans-serif always works.

### Imagery
* The imagery play very important role in all the website.I used so many photos in this website it's showed all the visiter to what we have in the Gym. The images in this website give positive energy to visiter and force them to click signup button. 
* All the images downloaded free from [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/gym%20and%20fitness/) website.
