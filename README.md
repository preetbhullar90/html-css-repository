## Introduction

The Silver Gym website is designed for individuals searching for a high quality gym. The purpose of this website is to showcase the facilities offered at this gym as well as the type of experience you can expect while using this gym.  The features of this website such as the gallery are aimed at motivating the customer to use silver gym for their fitness goals.
This website mainly focuses on informing potential customers about the facilities offered at this gym and what they can expect by joining. The page about trainers informs and motivates potential customers about the benefits they can get by joining and having access to highly qualified personal trainers. The Silver Gym website encourages people to join the gym to help keep their body healthy and strong.
Silver Gym website is my first Milestone Project out of five and its part of Full Stack Web development course at the Code Institute.
I mainly used HTML5 and CSS3 to make this website.

## Target
- On the website home page I  have added a big background image to try and motivate people to push towards their goals and look after their health.
- On the Home Page Everyone can see it's 20% off  for all  new members. I think this is a good way to support and encourage people to come and join silver gym.

#### Structure

* The type of site structure I have chosen for my website is a hierarchical structure which is demonstrated in the image below. The information architecture was arranged like this to ensure a user friendly experience as well as smooth navigation between the pages.

 ## Design

 ### Colour Schema
 * I used two colours for the background and content, which are white and dark grey. I have also used a small amount of green for hover and black for paragraph.
* I chose all the colours I used from [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/colors/colors_picker.asp) website.

#### Typography
* I selected the font I used  from the [Google font](https://fonts.google.com/) website and linked it with my Css file.
* I used three font style Lato,Oswald and sans-serif.
* I have used Lato only for the paragraphs.
* I have used Oswald for the headings.
* I have used the font Sans-serif for backup in instances where if the correct link isn’t provided to the css3 file, a font type is still available. If this occurs and the Google font does not work the backup font sans-serif will always work.

#### Imagery
* The images used in this website play a very important role in the user experience of the website.
* The images shown on the website have been selected to motivate the potential customer and encourage them to join the gym. They have also been included to educate new gym users on basic excersie tecniques.
* All the images are downloaded free from the [pexels](https://www.pexels.com/search/gym%20and%20fitness/) website.

### Header

In the header the main logo of the website is on the left hand side, and the navigation links are on the right hand side on all the pages.  On medium sized devices such as tablets the logo stays on the left hand side but the navigation links come under the logo in the middle. On small devices such as iPhones and Android phones both the logo and navigation bar move to the left hand side with the text in a small font size.

<a href="https://github.com/preetbhullar90/html-css-repository/blob/main/index.html" target="_blank" alt="SilverGym Home Page">Home Page</a>

The home page has a big hero image in the back. Under the hero image there are three blocks, one block is about facilities, and the other one is about Equipment and the last one is for trainers. Each block is linked to another page. Under the blocks there is a form section for Email, Phone number, Address , business Email and a link bar where the user can navigate to all the pages, a  google map of the business location is also featured.

<a href="https://github.com/preetbhullar90/html-css-repository/blob/main/gallery.html" target="_blank" alt="SilverGym Home Page">Gallery Page</a>

The gallery page features a lot of images about the gyms equipment and facilities. The gallery photos are divided in to columns, if the user is viewing the website on a big screen then the gallery will be displayed in four columns. On a medium sized screen the gallery will be seen in three columns. On small sized screens the user will see just two columns. If the user will hover the mouse over the images then images will zoom out slightly.

<a href="https://github.com/preetbhullar90/html-css-repository/blob/main/signup.html" target="_blank" alt="SilverGym Home Page">Signup Page</a>

On the signup page, the user will see a big signup form with space to enter your name, last Name, email, and password followed by a submit button . This submit form button is linked to the home page.  This form is the “join us” form, this is why when user will fill this form it will redirect them to the home page. The signup page has huge hero image with the following information underneath; Address, Email and linkbar.

<a href="https://github.com/preetbhullar90/html-css-repository/blob/main/trainners.html" target="_blank" alt="SilverGym Home Page">Trainers Page</a>

The trainer’s page has one big block which has four smaller blocks. Each block has a heading, image and paragraph. The blocks have a white background and each block shows different skills such as “what is a trainer’s role in your daily routine.”

<a href="https://github.com/preetbhullar90/html-css-repository/blob/main/facilities.html" target="_blank" alt="SilverGym Home Page">Faility Page</a>

The facilities page has a large variety of videos. Each video has a heading and paragraph.  The heading shows the name of the video and paragraphs explains how to exercise with each gym set. The videos are divided in to columns. On big screens the videos display horizontally in one line. On smaller screens they are displayed vertically in one column.

* ### Footer
 A footer is featured on the bottom of every page on the website. The footer has a social media heading and the following three social media icons; Facebook, YouTube, and twitter. Each Icon is linked directly with the corresponding website. Underneath each icons there is a p tag the p tag has year that the website was published and that all their rights are reserved.

## Bugs
* I had problem with make a blog in the home page. So i got help from [stackflow](https://stackoverflow.com/) and [W3school](https://www.w3schools.com/) to fix it.

## Issue Left
* No any issue left.

## Other Features
* The logo is linked to the home page when the user will click on the logo it will take them to the home page.
* On the form page, navigation bar and email have a hover option. When the user will hover their mouse over it, it will show a different colour. This makes it easier to understand for the user that this is clickable link.
* The home page block also has a hover option when the visitor will hover on it then the images will zoom out.


### Feature Left to Implement

* Navigation bar with a hamburger logo on a small screen. The reason why didn't implement this is because I need to use JavaScript to do this but this project only uses HTML5 and CSS3.
* The Signup form and email should give a response to the user on the users email. This could not be implemented because JavaScript and a data storage option like mongodb is need for this feature.
